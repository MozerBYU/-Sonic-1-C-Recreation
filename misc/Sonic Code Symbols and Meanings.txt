I've been digging through the Sonic 2 Nick Arcade and Sonic CD Gems collection symbols for a bit, among other things, and gathered a little collection of what certain labels were called in the source code:

Other information:

    Some of these other symbols were found in other data that hasn't been really properly documented out there yet. There's a whole section other symbols and even older code (I found an earlier version of the Emerald Hill boss and documented it here).
    Mappings and DPLCs were definitely done in assembly, possibly by hand. Sprite mappings are generally labelled as "XXXXXpat", with labels for each sprite frame generally being labelled as "XXXXXspNN".
    Tile data is labelled as "XXXXXcg".
    Sonic 1 special stage maps are labelled as 'rotmaptblN"
    Zones are referred to by their ID, not their name.
    PLC lists are just labelled as "ddevNN".
    There's a function that would load the Sonic 1 collision data if it was in Green Hill Zone, but it relies on how their development hardware worked, hence why it doesn't work in the build we have.
    An object's main routine index table is labelled as "XXXXX_move_tbl".
    An object's initialization routine is labelled as "XXXXXinit".
    An object's main update routine is labelled as "XXXXXmove".
    A common local label used when a free object slot was not found is ".worknai".
    There's actually a reference to a totally scrapped boss that appeared to initially been made for Chemical Plant. Said symbols are "vacumeguy" and "bossvac".
    Due to the nature of them using linking and XREFs, there's actually a couple of reused labels that are, of course, not exported.
    Sonic CD developers called the functions that refer to the animals being deleted with a bad future set and the badniks being destroyed with a good future set as "friend_suicide" and "enemy_suicide" respectively. I know that English wasn't their native tongue, but I found it amusing.
    Amy was called "emie" in Sonic CD's source code.
    The "I'm outta here" in Sonic CD routine is just called "bye".

Of course, this isn't every symbol that's been leaked out, and I'm lacking on Sonic CD's for now, but it's a good chunk I have documented. This should be helpful on documenting the rest later on. A while ago, I did do a quick test of setting up every label in TouchResponse/pcol here. RAM and object variables aren't set up, though, just the code labels.
