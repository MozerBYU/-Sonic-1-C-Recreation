** TO DO LIST **

- Rename files in music, sounds and textures
 -> Match naming convention "Full_name" or "full_name_#"

- Make sure all traces of m_zoneNameShort are gone (it was pointless and unnecessary)
- Follow file structure to see how it operates (what calls what)
- Diagram how it is all structured (for ease for future modders)
- Ensure all naming conventions match
- Refactoring as necessary
